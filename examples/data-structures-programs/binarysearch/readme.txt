1.Build a binary tree
2.Print all the paths of a Binary tree
4. Print a level order traversal
4. Print a reverse level order traversal
5. Fina all the leaf nodes of a tree
6. Check a given binary tree is balanced tree or not?
7. Check given binary tree is unival tree or not? 
	if so, count number of unival trees in a binary tree?
9. Check whether the given tree is "sum tree" or not
	- A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to sum of the nodes present 
	  left subtree and right subtree.
	- A leaf is also considered as "sum tree"
10. Create a mirror binary tree.
11. Check whether the given binary tree is a sum tree?




Heap data structure:
- Heap Data Structure is generally taught with Heapsort. 
  Heapsort algorithm has limited uses because Quicksort is better in practice
- Priority Queues can be efficiently implemented as Binary Heap
- Binomial Heap / Fibonacci Heap are other variations of Binary Heap
- maxheap - parent is greather than all of its children
- minheap - parent is smaller than all of its children
