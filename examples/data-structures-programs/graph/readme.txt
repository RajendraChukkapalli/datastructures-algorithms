1. Is there a path between two nodes in this undirected graph? 
2. What's the shortest path between two nodes in this undirected, unweighted graph? 
3. Can this undirected graph be colored with two colors?
4. Does this undirected graph have a cycle? 
5. Dijkstra's Algorithm: (Finds the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in a weighted graph)
6. Topological Sort Arranges the nodes in a directed, acyclic graph in a special order based on incoming edges.
7. Minimum Spanning Tree (Finds the cheapest set of edges needed to reach all nodes in a weighted graph)
